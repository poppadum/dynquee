# For each EmulationStation action, define a rule for the search order
# Rule meanings:
#   rom: ROM-specific media file
#   publisher: publisher media file
#   genre: genre media file (not implemented yet)
#   system: system media file
#   generic: a media file unrelated to a game, system or publisher
#   scraped: game's scraped image
#
