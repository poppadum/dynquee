#
# For each EmulationStation action, define a rule for the search order
# Rule meanings:
# * rom: ROM-specific media e.g. marquee image for the selected game
# * scraped: the selected game's scraped image
# * publisher: media relating to the publisher of game e.g. Atari or Taito logo
# * genre: media relating to genre of game e.g. shooters, platform games
# * system: media relating to game system e.g. ZX Spectrum or SNES logo
# * generic: generic media unrelated to a game, system or publisher
# * blank: blank the display e.g. when EmulationStation goes to sleep
#
# Note: I ignore the `endgame` and `wakeup` actions as EmulationStation
# sends another action immediately after
#
