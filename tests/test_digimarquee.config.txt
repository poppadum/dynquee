[media]

# path where marquee media files are located
media_path = tests/media

# Path to default image relative to BASE_PATH
# This is used as a media file of last resort, in case
# no other media files could be found
default_image = default.png

## Media search precedence rules ##
#
# For each EmulationStation action, specify the order to search for media.
#
# Valid actions are:
# * systembrowsing - user is browsing list of systems
# * gamelistbrowing - user has selected a system and is browsling list of games
# * rungame - user has started a game
# * endgame - user has exited a game
# * sleep - EmulationStation has entered sleep mode
# * wakeup - EmulationStation was woken up after sleep
#
# Rule components (search terms):
# * rom: ROM-specific media e.g. marquee image for the selected game
# * scraped: the selected game's scraped image
# * publisher: media relating to the publisher of game e.g. Atari or Taito banner
# * genre: media relating to genre of game e.g. shooters, platform games
# * system: media relating to game system e.g. Sinclair Spectrum or SNES banner
# * generic: generic media unrelated to a game, system or publisher
# * blank: blank the display e.g. when EmulationStation goes to sleep
#
# Search terms can be combined at the same precedence with + character
# e.g.  `rungame = rom+publisher+system genre scraped generic`
# will first try to locate media for rom, publisher and system and show them all.
#
# Note: ignore the `endgame` and `wakeup` actions as EmulationStation
# sends another action immediately after
#
rungame = rom scraped publisher system genre generic
gamelistbrowsing = system generic
systembrowsing = generic
sleep = blank
# default precedence to use if action does not match one of those above
default = generic

## Marquee change settings ##
#
# These settings control when the marquee will change depending on
# the EmulationStation action, and which system or game is selected.
#
# Don't change marquee for these actions:
no_change_on = endgame wakeup
#
# Change marquee if this attribute changes
# Valid values are:
# * always - any action except those specified in `no_change_on` above changes marquee
# * action - a change of action (different to previous action) changes marquee
# * system - a change of selected game system changes marquee
# * game - a change of selected game changes marquee
# * system/game - a change of EITHER selected system OR game changes marquee
# * never - marquee never changes but stays on startup media
#
change_on = system/game
