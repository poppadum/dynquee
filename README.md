## About dynquee

### What Is It?
*dynquee* (pronounced '[dinky][dinky-definition]') is a program to run a dynamic marquee for [Recalbox]. The name stands for **dyn**amic mar**quee**.

It was originally intended to run on a [Raspberry Pi 4B][pi4] with two displays, Recalbox using the primary display for games and *dynquee* driving a second display for the marquee, similar to the [PiMarquee2][pimarquee2] project for [Retropie][retropie]. But it can also run on Recalbox on PC, and on a separate device communicating with Recalbox via the network.

### Why?
I'm building a bartop arcade machine and I want to have a dynamic marquee which can change depending on which game system is selected and which game is being played.

I'm using [Recalbox] to run the machine on a [Raspberry Pi 4][pi4]. As the Pi4 has dual HDMI outputs I want to drive the marquee from the second HDMI output. 

The marquee display I have is an [ultrawide 19" 1920x360 LED panel][DV190FBM] which is the ideal size for my build. It was quite expensive and hard to obtain; another possiblity would be a [cheaper 14.9" TN panel][LTA149B780F] available from Amazon or ebay.

For testing I used a spare 19" TV running at 720p resolution.

This project is the result of my attempts to get a dynamic marquee working with [Recalbox].

### Goals
I wanted a solution which would be:

- fairly lightweight: work with Recalbox's environment, ideally needing no extra software to be installed
- flexible: allow most settings to be changed via a config file
- reactive: change the marquee in response to user actions


### How Does It Work?
It works very like [Recalbox]'s built-in mini TFT support: 
it listens to [Recalbox's MQTT broker][recalbox-mqtt] for events,
and displays still images or videos in response to those events.

On PC it uses `mpv` to display media on the secondary screen.
On Raspberry Pi it writes media files direct to the framebuffer using `fbv2` for still images and `ffmpeg` for videos.

With the Pi4's default KMS graphics driver both HDMI displays share a single framebuffer, so marquee images are also visible on the primary display for a second or two when an emulator launches or exits. While this is a bit annoying, it doesn't seem to break anything so I put up with it.

*dynquee* is written in Python 3 with a few supporting bash scripts.


### Requirements
- [Recalbox] v8.1.1 Electron or later
- one of:
    - a Raspberry [Pi 4B][pi4] or [Pi 400][pi400] with a second display connected to the Pi's second HDMI port
    - a PC with dual video outputs and two displays
    - a separate device with a connected display: an older Pi or [Pi Zero][pi-zero] should be ideal

I have tested *dynquee* running on a different device on the same network as the Recalbox machine.
It works fine but needs a few config file changes: see [Running *dynquee* on a different device][install-different-device].


### Status
*dynquee* is now pretty stable but there may still be bugs.

I've tried to minimise the risk of displaying the same image for a long period of time
because I'm concerned about [image persistence or burn-in][screen-burn-in] (probably a habit I picked up in the 1980s).
While this shouldn't be too much of a problem if you're using a modern LCD display for your marquee, I still recommend keeping an eye on it.


### Tested Platforms
*dynquee* has been tested on the following platforms:

* Running on Recalbox:
    * Recalbox v8.1.1 & v9.0 on Raspberry Pi 4B: working
    * Recalbox v9.0.1 on PC: working

* Running on a separate device:
    * Raspberry Pi Zero: working
    * Raspberry Pi 1B: working, but a bit too slow to be useable

## Getting Started

* To get *dynquee* running on Recalbox follow the instructions below.

* To get *dynquee* running on a different machine see [installing on a different device][install-different-device].

Releases include a few media files to get started (see [acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)) but not a complete set. See the [media README][media-readme] for suggestions of where to find media files.


### Quick Installation

Follow these steps to install *dynquee* using the install script:

1. Connect to your recalbox with `ssh` (the [Recalbox wiki][recalbox-ssh] explains how)
1. Copy and paste this command and press enter:  
    ```sh
    bash -c "$(wget -qO - https://github.com/poppadum/dynquee/raw/main/install/install.sh)"
    ```
1. If all goes well you should see the *Installation complete* message


### Manual Installation
If you prefer to install everything manually,
follow [this guide for Raspberry Pi][manual-install-rpi]
or [this guide for PC][manual-install-pc].


## Usage
Most settings can be configured in the config file [`dynquee.ini`](dynquee.ini).
Read the comments in that file and read the [configuration guide][config-guide] for full details.

## Help

If things aren't working, first check the log files in the `logs/` directory:  
- `logs/dynquee.log` contains the summary log
- `logs/dynquee.debug.log` contains the full debug log

The logs should provide some clues as to what is wrong.

If you are having trouble getting *dynquee* to start on PC, also check the file `/tmp/dynquee_start.log`.

If you still can't get it working, post on the [Recalbox forum][recalbox-forum-commproj] and I will try to help.
Please paste your config file and debug log file on [pastebin][pastebin] and provide a link when reporting issues.

Many thanks to @toniosj for Recalbox PC testing.

## To Do
- [ ] Genre matching is very dumb: make it more useful.  
  Is there a master list of genres that [Emulation Station][emulationstation] uses somewhere?
